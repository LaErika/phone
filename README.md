# Phone
Phone number parser for numbers in international standard for Elixir.

## About
What will be and what wont be about Phone:
  - It wont be:
    1. Intended to work as libphonenumber.
    2. Prepared to format numbers.
    3. Necessary any information about the number if in international standard.
  - It will be:
    1. A real parser, created to extract information based only in the number.
    2. Prepared to work with numbers not only in the international standard.
    3. Prepared for internationalization.


## Progress
I've done NANP countries and areas, Norway, Australia, Russia, Kazakhstan and countries that 2-letter code starts with A and B.
I perceived that I had a lot of repeating code and it was really unnecessary, so I've been studing metaprograming to solve this.

## Vocabulary
  - a2: Alpha-2, two letters code for country names.
  - a3: Alpha-3, three letters code for country names.
  - NANP: North American Numbering Plan, numbering plan for countries with international code number 1.

## Installation
Not ready for use.
